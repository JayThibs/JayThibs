## I'm a French Canadian, ML Developer, and Physicist!

- üìÑ Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v-Nb-F6FRKzASZnj8FevNOK86iPDbxnv2l5VrJBaeQM/edit?usp=sharing) and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacques-thibodeau/).
- üå± I‚Äôm currently focused on creating impactful datasets and using language models (like GPT) as tools for accelerating AI alignment.
- ü•Ö 2022 Goals: Produce content on my [blog][website] to teach people about ML in Production. Learn more about AI Safety (and AGI).

<br />

### Current Projects

* [Language Models as Tools for AI Alignment Research](https://github.com/moirage/alignment-research-dataset): As part of the [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp/), my team is working on fine-tuning a custom dataset of AI Safety relevant resources (papers, blog posts, books, etc.) on GPT models to accelerate alignment research. Our team is also collaborating with people at [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/). If you'd like to contribute, please join the EleutherAI Discord and go to the #accelerate-alignment channel.
* [Transformers from Scratch](https://github.com/JayThibs/transformers-from-scratch): Transformers are amazing. I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty so I'm spending some time learning the theory and implementation from scratch.

### Highlighted Projects:

* [Map Floodwater with Satellite Imagery](https://github.com/JayThibs/map-floodwater-satellite-imagery): Trained multiple models with **PyTorch Lightning** and **Wandb** in **AWS SageMaker** and Google Colab to predict floodwater in satellite imagery. Deployed the best model for prediction via a **Streamlit web app**.
* [A Case Study on Weakly Supervised Learning](https://github.com/JayThibs/Weak-Supervised-Learning-Case-Study): Chosen as a top project in the **Full Stack Deep Learning** course of over 300 professionals. Deployed **NLP** models on **Azure** and called the deployed models for text data labelling. (**PyTorch**, **HuggingFace**, **Snorkel**)
* [HyperDrive vs AutoML + Deployment in Azure](https://github.com/JayThibs/hyperdrive-vs-automl-plus-deployment): Trained tabular models using **hyperparameter search** and **AutoML**. Deployed the best **XGBoost** model.
* [Berdi](https://github.com/CER-REC/esa-data-bank_banque-donnees-ees): Grabbing PDFs from a database, extracting text and figures, and preparing for use in a search tool my team has created. Set up code review process and reorganized the structure of the entire repository.

### Languages and Tools:

* **Primary Languages**: **Python**, SQL
* **ML Frameworks**: **PyTorch Lightning**, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, HuggingFace, spaCy, Fastai, Keras (TensorFlow), PySpark
* **ML Techniques**: **NLP**, Tabular ML, Semantic Segmentation / Computer Vision, GitHub Actions
* **ML Tools**: Weights and Biases, Snorkel, Tableau, Streamlit, FastAPI, Label Studio
* **Cloud Computing**: **AWS** (SageMaker, Lambda, Docker, CloudWatch, S3), Azure Machine Learning, Google Cloud Platform
