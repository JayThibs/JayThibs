## I'm a French Canadian, ML Developer, and Physicist!

- üìÑ Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v-Nb-F6FRKzASZnj8FevNOK86iPDbxnv2l5VrJBaeQM/edit?usp=sharing) and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacques-thibodeau/).
- üå± I‚Äôm currently focused on **building ML in production efficiently and safely**.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to **collaborate with others** on end-to-end ML projects ü§ì
- ü•Ö 2021-2022 Goals: Produce content on my [blog][website] to teach people about ML in Production.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I like martial arts ü§∫ and used to host a radio show!

### Highlighted Projects:

* [Map Floodwater with Satellite Imagery](https://github.com/JayThibs/map-floodwater-satellite-imagery): Trained multiple models with **PyTorch Lightning** and **Wandb** in **AWS SageMaker** and Google Colab to predict floodwater in satellite imagery. Deployed the best model for prediction via a **Streamlit web app**.
* [A Case Study on Weakly Supervised Learning](https://github.com/JayThibs/Weak-Supervised-Learning-Case-Study): Chosen as a top project in the **Full Stack Deep Learning** course of over 300 professionals. Deployed **NLP** models on **Azure** and called the deployed models for text data labelling. (**PyTorch**, **HuggingFace**, **Snorkel**)
* [HyperDrive vs AutoML + Deployment in Azure](https://github.com/JayThibs/hyperdrive-vs-automl-plus-deployment): Trained tabular models using **hyperparameter search** and **AutoML**. Deployed the best **XGBoost** model.
* [Operationalizing ML in Azure](https://github.com/JayThibs/Operationalizing-ML-with-Azure): Created an AutoML training and **deployment pipeline**.

### Current Projects

* [GPT StackOverflow QA](https://github.com/JayThibs/gpt-stackoverflow-QA) and [GPT Experiments](https://github.com/JayThibs/gpt-experiments): I am currently working on doing some prompt engineering and fine-tuning with GPT models. Latest experiment was fine-tuning GPT-2 on Elon Musk tweets. Now working on fine-tuning GPT-J with GCP TPUs on StackOverflow questions and answers.
* [Transformers from Scratch](https://github.com/JayThibs/transformers-from-scratch): Transformers are amazing. I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty so I'm spending some time learning the theory and implementation from scratch.
* [Berdi](https://github.com/CER-REC/esa-data-bank_banque-donnees-ees): Work project. It involves grabbing PDFs from a database, extracting text and figures, and preparing for use in a search tool my team has created. I'm currently restructuring the repository and implementing best practices.
* [Canada Energy Regulator Question-Answering App](https://github.com/JayThibs/cer-qa-app): Work project. This is a project where I extract and clean texts from PDFs, train a QA model using Haystack and Hugginface Transformers, then deploy it for natural language question-answering for internal stakeholders.

### Languages and Tools:

* **Primary Languages**: **Python**, SQL
* **ML Frameworks**: **PyTorch Lightning**, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, HuggingFace, spaCy, Fastai, Keras (TensorFlow), PySpark
* **ML Techniques**: **NLP**, Tabular ML, Semantic Segmentation / Computer Vision, GitHub Actions
* **ML Tools**: Weights and Biases, Snorkel, Tableau, Streamlit, FastAPI, Label Studio
* **Cloud Computing**: **AWS** (SageMaker, Lambda, Docker, CloudWatch, S3), Azure Machine Learning, Google Cloud Platform

Note: Above lists are loosely representative of the order in which I am skilled in those languages and tools.
