## I'm a French Canadian working on AI Alignment!

- üìÑ Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJ4z6LjEponHrweObPjoFEssXYWJKzeCkRlKOXDPOX0/edit?usp=sharing) and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacques-thibodeau/). For my AI alignment takes, [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jacques-thibodeau)'s my LessWrong profile.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently focused on creating impactful datasets and using language models (like GPT) as tools for accelerating AI alignment.
- ü•Ö 2022 Goals: learn more about AI Safety (and AGI).

### Current Project(s)

* [Language Models as Tools for AI Alignment Research](https://github.com/moirage/alignment-research-dataset): As part of the [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp/), my team is working on fine-tuning a custom dataset of AI Safety relevant resources (papers, blog posts, books, etc.) on GPT models to accelerate alignment research. Our team is also collaborating with people at [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/). If you'd like to contribute, please join the EleutherAI Discord and go to the #accelerate-alignment channel.

### Languages and Tools:

* **Primary Language**: **Python**
* **ML Frameworks**: **PyTorch Lightning**, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, HuggingFace, spaCy, Fastai, Keras (TensorFlow), PySpark
* **ML Techniques**: **NLP**, Tabular ML, Semantic Segmentation / Computer Vision, GitHub Actions
* **ML Tools**: Weights and Biases, Snorkel, Tableau, Streamlit, FastAPI, Label Studio
* **Cloud Computing**: **AWS** (SageMaker, Lambda, Docker, CloudWatch, S3), Azure Machine Learning, Google Cloud Platform
